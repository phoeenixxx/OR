The _calculate_potentials() function solves for the dual variables, or potentials ($u_i$ for rows and $v_j$ for columns), using the governing equation $u_i + v_j = c_{ij}$ exclusively across the current basic cells. These potentials are then utilized to calculate the reduced cost for every non-basic cell using the formula: $\\bar{c}_{ij} = c_{ij} - (u_i + v_j)$. Optimality is achieved when all reduced costs are non-negative ($\\bar{c}_{ij} \\ge 0$).\n",

The _find_cycle(start\\_pos) method, using a Depth-First Search (DFS) methodology, traces the unique closed loop formed by the entering cell and the existing basic variables. The pivoting operation calculates $\\Theta$ (Theta), the minimum allocation found on the negative-signed nodes of the cycle, which dictates the maximum feasible flow shift. The flows are updated by adding and subtracting $\\Theta$ around the cycle, and the cell that first reaches zero flow becomes the leaving variable, completing the basis exchange and advancing to a better basic feasible solution."
